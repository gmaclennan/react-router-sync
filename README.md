# react-router-sync

**This is a proof of concept, I don't know if it is the correct approach to this problem. This may not be maintained in the future. If you think this approach works and would like to continue develop this I'm happy to accept contributors or transfer the repo.**

`react-router-sync` is designed to help keep [`react-router@4.x`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/v4) in sync with a global state in an app that uses [`redux`](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/) or similar.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gmaclennan/react-router-sync.git
cd react-router-sync
npm install
```

## Usage

Please see the examples:

- [Redux](/redux-example/index.js): `npm run redux`
- [Component State](/manual-tests/index.js): `npm start`
